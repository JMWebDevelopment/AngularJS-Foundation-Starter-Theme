# AngularJS Foundation Starter Theme
The WP REST API has been merged into core beginning with WordPress 4.7. It's a great way to show off posts in a quick and easy manner. This is a starter theme, which is based off of AngularJS, the Foundation framework and JointsWP, for those of you who are like me and trying to figure out a way to create a theme with the WP REST API. This theme is by no means perfect, but it's a work in progress and it is a starting point. Download the entire thing or pick and chose what parts you need, like displaying comments in a threaded manner, to implement the API in your theme. Have fun!

### Installation
- Download the GitHub zip file and upload it to your theme, or clone the repo into your theme directory.
- Make sure you are running WordPress 4.7 and activate the theme.
- Make sure your permalink settings are set to "Date and Name."
- That's it. You're good to go.

### To do
Obviously this is still a work in progress. Here's what's on my to-do list for the starter theme.
- ~~Figure out routes to get posts by day, month and year~~
- Work on adding support for translations.

### Changelog
